This is my first attempt at building a machine learning model. I only attempted to build a linear model, although I'm sure other models, would have yielded better results. The model attempts to predict the sales price for a NYC properties given a few geographic and descriptive variables. Although this model wasn't very successful, I am looking forward to building on the foundational knowledge I acquired during this project
